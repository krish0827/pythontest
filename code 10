HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade  in the inclusive range from 1 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round  up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38 , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade

def gradingStudents(grades):
    rounded=[]
    n=len(grades)
    for i in range(n):
        if grades[i]<38:
            rounded.append(grades[i])
        else:
            next_multiple=((grades[i]//5)+1)*5
            if next_multiple - grades[i] < 3:
                rounded.append(next_multiple)
            else:
                rounded.append(grades[i])
            
    return rounded

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    grades_count = int(input().strip())

    grades = []

    for _ in range(grades_count):
        grades_item = int(input().strip())
        grades.append(grades_item)

    result = gradingStudents(grades)

    fptr.write('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    fptr.write('\n')

    fptr.close()
