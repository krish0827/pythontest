Given a number n, for each integer in the range from 1 to n inclusive, print one value per line as follows:
If is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
If is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), print Fizz.
If is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), print Buzz.
If i is not a multiple of 3 or 5. print the value of i


def fizzBuzz(n):
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 != 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
    fizzBuzz(n)
